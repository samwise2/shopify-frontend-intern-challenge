# Sam Orend - Shopify Frontend Internship Challenge
The Shoppies!

This is the github repo for my Fall 2021 Shopify Frontend Internship Challenge!

Features I added beyond the challenge description:
- Auto-saving nominations using localStorage (You can refresh the page or return to the link at a later time and your nominations will still be there, no need to manually save)
- Click to View More Info About Your Nominees (You can click on the titles of your nominees to view a popup with more information about them!)

Technical Notes:
- Developed using React and Bootstrap
- Requests sent to the OMDB API
